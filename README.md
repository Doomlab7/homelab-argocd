# argocd-helm

## TODOs

1. Trying to follow https://www.arthurkoziel.com/setting-up-argocd-with-helm/ but getting stuck on deploying root-app. I've verifed that I can `git clone` from an argocd pod though
2. Once I figure that out I want to deploy openfaas as an argocd application, not sure if I should with a template via root-app app-of-apps model, or using terraform... I want to use tf so that I can start messing with terrakube
